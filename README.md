# OReilly_R_Tidyverse_Core_Competencies_Pre-work
Pre-work exercises for the O'Reilly live online learning course 

This course serves as an introduction to the R Tidyverse. As an introduction to the topic, let's take a look at the data sets we'll use in the course and see if you can analyse them with your current R knowledge, which is likely to be base package.

## Exercises

In the data folder you'll find four sub-folders containing data files. Below I give a brief description of the data and some analtical questions we'd like to answer.

Take a look at the files, and for each exercise, write at least pseudo code describing how you would tackle the solution. If you're motivated, try to execute your analysis in R.

### Dataset 1: meditation

This is the result of an experiment to measure the relative gene expression level of 6 pro-inflammatory genes in two groups of individuals: those with a history of meditation and those without. Measurements were taken in the morning (time 1) and in the afternoon (time 2) after a full day of mediating (experimental group) or liesure (control).

### Dataset 2: plants

In these data files we have the dry weight of 30 plants evenly split among 3 treatment groups -- control, treatment 1 and treatment 2.

### Dataset 3: science

This file contains over 1200 proteins and their abundances identified using mass spectometry.

### Dataset 4: weather

These four files contain the average daily temperatures for four ;major world cities: Paris, New York, London and Reykjavik.
